This is a basic but fun API that will display random cat facts eitehr one at a time or multiple:
- Clone the project (or download zip) and open it in IntelliJ.
- Make sure jdk versions match.
- Run the main method.

Try the following GET commands  on POSTMAN to test the API:
http://localhost:8080/catfacts/random <br />
http://localhost:8080/catfacts/multiple ---> will give more than one fact
